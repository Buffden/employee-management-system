User -> Frontend: 1. Fill department form (name, description, budget)
User -> Frontend: 2. Select location
User -> Frontend: 3. Optionally select department head
User -> Frontend: 4. Click "Create Department"

Frontend -> Gateway: 5. POST /api/departments\nAuthorization: Bearer {token}\n(DepartmentRequestDTO)
Gateway -> Gateway: 6. Forward to Backend

participant "JwtAuthenticationFilter" as JwtFilter
participant "SecurityService" as SecurityService

Gateway -> JwtFilter: 7. Intercept request
JwtFilter -> JwtFilter: 8. Validate JWT token
JwtFilter -> JwtFilter: 9. Extract role from token
JwtFilter -> Controller: 10. Forward request

Controller -> Controller: 11. Check @PreAuthorize\n(hasRole('SYSTEM_ADMIN'))

alt Insufficient permissions
    Controller --> Gateway: 12. HTTP 403 Forbidden
    Gateway --> Frontend: 13. Access denied
    Frontend --> User: 14. Show error message
else Authorized
    Controller -> SecurityService: 15. getCurrentUserRole()
    SecurityService --> Controller: 16. Role (must be 'SYSTEM_ADMIN')
    
    Controller -> Service: 17. create(DepartmentRequestDTO)

alt Department head is provided
    Service -> EmpRepo: 8. getById(departmentHeadId)
    EmpRepo -> DB: 9. SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id = ?
    DB --> EmpRepo: 10. Employee entity
    EmpRepo --> Service: 11. DepartmentHead
end

Service -> LocRepo: 12. getById(locationId)
LocRepo -> DB: 13. SELECT * FROM location WHERE id = ?
DB --> LocRepo: 14. Location entity
LocRepo --> Service: 15. Location

Service -> Service: 16. Validate department name (unique)
Service -> DeptRepo: 17. findByName(name)
DeptRepo -> DB: 18. SELECT * FROM department WHERE name = ?
DB --> DeptRepo: 19. Optional<Department>
DeptRepo --> Service: 20. Optional (empty if new)

alt Department name exists
    Service --> Controller: 18. Throw exception: "Department name already exists"
    Controller --> Gateway: 19. HTTP 400 Bad Request
    Gateway --> Frontend: 20. Error response
    Frontend --> User: 21. Display error message
else Department name is unique
    Service -> Mapper: 22. toEntity(DTO, location, head)
    Mapper --> Service: 23. Department entity
    
    Service -> DeptRepo: 24. save(Department)
    DeptRepo -> DB: 25. INSERT INTO department
    DB --> DeptRepo: 26. Saved department
    DeptRepo --> Service: 27. Department
    
    Service -> Mapper: 28. toResponseDTO(Department)
    Mapper --> Service: 29. DepartmentResponseDTO
    
    Service --> Controller: 30. DepartmentResponseDTO
    Controller --> Gateway: 31. HTTP 201 Created
    Gateway --> Frontend: 32. Response with department data
    Frontend -> User: 33. Display success message and department details

note right of JwtFilter
  **RBAC:**
  - Validates JWT token
  - Extracts role
  - Sets SecurityContext
end note

note right of Controller
  **Authorization:**
  Only SYSTEM_ADMIN
  can create departments
  @PreAuthorize enforces
  this at method level
end note

note right of Service
  **Business Rules:**
  - Department name must be unique
  - Location must exist
  - Department head must exist (if provided)
end note

note right of Mapper
  **Adapter Pattern:**
  Converts DTO ↔ Entity
end note
