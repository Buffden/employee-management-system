# Use Case Diagrams

This directory contains use case diagrams showing actors and their interactions with the system.

## What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use case diagrams show **WHAT** the system does - the functional requirements from a user's perspective.

**Purpose**:
- Show system functionality
- Identify actors and their roles
- Document business requirements
- High-level system understanding

## Use Case vs Sequence Diagram

| Aspect | Use Case Diagram | Sequence Diagram |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Shows** | WHAT the system does | HOW the system works |
| **Level** | Business/Functional | Technical/Implementation |
| **Audience** | Business, Product Owners | Developers, Architects |
| **Focus** | User interactions | Object interactions |
| **Detail** | High-level | Detailed step-by-step |

**Both are valuable** - Use cases show requirements, sequences show implementation.
