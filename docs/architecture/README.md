## Architecture Principles

1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns (Controller → Service → Repository)
2. **Microservices Ready**: Stateless services for horizontal scaling
3. **Design Patterns**: Systematic application of GoF patterns
4. **Cloud-Native**: Built for cloud deployment (AWS)
5. **Container-First**: Docker-based development and deployment
